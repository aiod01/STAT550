## Brief Summary of Project
A "rapidly aging" population is a phenomena describing the size growth of senior subpopulations. In many nations, the population percentage of seniors has rapidly grown over the past several decades. Recent literature also shows that senior workers continue to participate in the labor market. They often aspire to develop their skills for the work environment, often through various education programs. A key objective of this study is to discern how organizational and learning factors are associated with either skill usage or skill proficiency of senior workers in South Korea. Identifying these factors is a critical research issue, since skill usage of workers is a key area to improve both individual and organizational performance. Our study will use data publicly available from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). The dataset has been restricted to only include baby boomers and traditionalists (50-54 and 55-65 years old) who were employed in the private sector at the time of survey in South Korea. There are a total of 1247 observations within the dataset to be used for our analyses. Most of the variables in the data also fall into one of three categories: "demographic", "organizational" and "educational". We expect any significant findings to contribute to the field of adult education and organization development.
